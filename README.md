# Railgun-Optimization
Optimizing the input current to a railgun using FEM and Python scripting

Hey there!

Glad you found your way to my humble repository, this porject was very fun for me, our final course evaluation was meant to combine all the computer physics, simulation, and scripting skills we had gained and I decided that all of that was best put to use doing a low-level railgun simulation.

Now of course railguns are hyper complex but I simplified it down to crunchable numbers for a 2nd year engineering student. The main goal was to optimize the input current to the railgun minimizing both the force exerted on the rails by too much current, and the drop of the porjectile due to gravity from too low a current.

In the end an accuracy of almost 85%! That's pretty fantastic...

...oh I guess I should mention the target was a wizard lizard trapped in a wizards cage (don't ask) about 100m away.

If you're a nerd feel free to look over my python script (but be warned the path variables of any system you run it on need to be configured to run FlexPDE6s directly)

Otherwise the report can let you know all about the details.


Cheers!
